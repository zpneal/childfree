\arguments{
\item{waves}{vector: a numeric vector containing the SOSS waves to include (currently available: 79, 82, 84, 85, 86)}

\item{extra.vars}{vector: a character vector containing the names of variables to be retained from the raw data}

\item \emph{Family Status Variables} (based on \href{https://doi.org/10.1177/10664807231198869}{Neal and Neal's (2024)} framework)
\itemize{
\item \code{cf_want} (factor) - Is the respondent childfree according to a "want" variable
\item \code{famstat} (factor) - Respondent's family status based on all available information:
\itemize{

\item A "Not yet parent" does not have children but wants children
\item A "Childless" respondent does not have children, are not planning to have children, but wished they had children
\item An "Ambivalent non-parent" does not have children, are not planning to have children, and do not know if they wished they had children
\item An "Undecided" respondent does not have children and is undecided whether they want children
\item A "Childfree" respondent does not have children and does not want children

}
\item \emph{Design Variables}
\itemize{
\item \code{id} (string) - Unique respondent ID
\item \code{country} (string) - Respondent's country of residence (\emph{The SOSS is collected only in the United States, specifically, Michigan})

\description{
Read and recode Michigan State of the State (SOSS) data
}
\details{
The State of the State Survey (SOSS) is regularly collected by the Institute for Public Policy and
Social Research (IPPSR) at Michigan State University (MSU). Each wave is collected from a sample
of 1000 adults in the US state of Michigan, and includes sampling weights to obtain a sample that
is representative of the state's population with respect to age, gender, race, and education. The
\code{soss()} function reads the raw data from IPPSR's website, extracts and recodes selected variables
useful for studying childfree adults and other family statuses, then returns a single data frame. Questions
necessary for identifying childfree adults were asked in five waves, which each include unique questions
that may be of interest:
\itemize{
\item \href{http://ippsr.msu.edu/survey-research/state-state-survey-soss/soss-data/soss-79b-spring-2020}{Wave 79} (May 2020) - Neighborhoods, Health care, COVID, Personality
\item \href{http://ippsr.msu.edu/survey-research/state-state-survey-soss/soss-data/soss-82-fall-2021}{Wave 82} (September 2021) - Trust in government, Critical Race Theory
\item \href{http://ippsr.msu.edu/survey-research/state-state-survey-soss/soss-data/soss-84-spring-2022}{Wave 84} (April 2022) - Trust in scientists, Autonomous vehicles, Morality
\item \href{http://ippsr.msu.edu/survey-research/state-state-survey-soss/soss-data/soss-85-fall-2022}{Wave 85} (September 2022) - Reproductive rights, Race equity
\item \href{http://ippsr.msu.edu/survey-research/state-state-survey-soss/soss-data/soss-86-winter-2022}{Wave 86} (December 2022) - Education, Infrastructure
}

\strong{Known SOSS data file issues}
\itemize{
\item Wave 79 did not include a "do not know" option for selected questions. Therefore, it is not possible to identify
"undecided" or "ambivalent non-parent" respondents. This may lead other family status categories to be inflated.
\item Wave 82 originally included a 500 person oversample of parents. These respondents are omitted if \code{wave == 82}.
