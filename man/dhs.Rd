\usage{
dhs(files, extra.vars = NULL, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{vector: a character vector containing the paths for one or more Individual Recode DSH data files (see details)}

\item{extra.vars}{vector: a character vector containing the names of variables to be retained from the raw data}

\item{progress}{boolean: display a progress bar}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\itemize{
\item \emph{Family Status Variables} (based on \href{https://doi.org/10.1177/10664807231198869}{Neal and Neal's (2024)} framework)
\itemize{
\item \code{cf_want} (binary) - Is the respondent childfree according to a "want" variable
\item \code{cf_ideal} (binary) - Is the respondent childfree according to an "ideal" variable
\item \code{famstat} (factor) - Respondent's family status based on all available information:
\itemize{
\item A "Parent - Unclassified" has children
\item A "Parent - Fulfilled" has exactly the number of children that is ideal
\item A "Parent - Unfulfilled" has fewer children than is ideal
\item A "Parent - Reluctant" has more children than is ideal
\item A "Parent - Ambivalent" has children but does not know how many is ideal
\item A "Not yet parent" does not have children but wants children
\item A "Childless - Biological" respondent does not have children and is infecund but ideally would have liked to have children
\item An "Ambivalent non-parent" does not have children and is infecund but does not know if they ideally would have liked to have children
\item An "Undecided" respondent does not have children and is undecided whether they want children, or provided
inconsistent responses to the want and ideal questions (e.g., want = no, ideal > 0; want = yes, ideal = 0).
\item A "Childfree" respondent does not have children and does not want children or ideally would like zero children. If the respondent
provided responses to \emph{both} the want and ideal questions, these responses are consistent (i.e., want = no \emph{and} ideal = 0).
}
}
\item \emph{Demographic Variables}
\itemize{
\item \code{sex} (factor) - Respondent's sex
\item \code{age} (numeric) - Respondent's age in years
\item \code{education} (numeric) - Respondent's years of education
\item \code{partnered} (factor) - Respondent's partnership status
\item \code{residence} (factor) - Urbanicity of respondent's place of residence
\item \code{employed} (binary) - Whether respondent is currently employed
}
\item \emph{Attitude and Behavior Variables}
\itemize{
\item \code{religion} (factor) - Respondent's religious affiliation
}
\item \emph{Design Variables}
\itemize{
\item \code{id} (string) - Unique respondent ID
\item \code{country} (string) - Respondent's country of residence
\item \code{weight} (numeric) - Sampling weight (\emph{Exercise caution using weights when data are pooled from multiple countries or waves})
\item \code{file} (string) - Source data file
\item \code{survey} (string) - Source survey
\item \code{wave} (numeric) - Wave of data collection
\item \code{year} (numeric) - Year of data collection
\item \code{month} (numeric) - Month of data collection

\description{
Read and recode UN Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) individual data
}
\details{
The United Nations Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program regularly collects health data from
population-representative samples in many countries using standardized surveys. The "individual
recode" data files contain women's responses, and are available in SPSS, SAS, and Stata formats
from \href{https://www.dhsprogram.com/}{https://www.dhsprogram.com/}. Access to these data requires
a free application, however a sample data file can be obtained \href{https://dhsprogram.com/data/Download-Model-Datasets.cfm}{here}
without an application. The \code{dhs()} function reads one or more of these files, extracts and
recodes selected variables useful for studying childfree adults and other family statuses, then returns
a single data frame.

\strong{Known issues}
\itemize{
\item The SPSS-formatted files containing data from Gabon Recode 4 (GAIR41FL.SAV) and Turkey Recode 4 (TRIR41FL.SAV)
contain encoding errors. Use the SAS-formatted files (GAIR41FL.SAS7BDAT and TRIR41FL.SAS7BDAT) instead.
\item In some cases, DHS makes available individual recode data files for specific states. For example, data from Ondo
State in Nigeria from Wave 1 is contained in OSIR01FL.SAV, data from states in India from 1999 are contained in
files named XXIR42FL.SAV, where the "XX" is a two-letter state code. This function only accepts whole-country
individual recode data files, and not these state-specific data files.
