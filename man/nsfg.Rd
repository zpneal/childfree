Read and recode National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) data
}
\details{
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control \href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm}{National Survey of Family Growth} (NSFG)
regularly collects fertility and other health information from a population-representative sample of adults in the
United States. Between 1973 and 2002, the NSFG was conducted periodically. Starting in 2002, the NSFG transitioned to
continuous data collection, releasing data in three-year waves (e.g., the 2013-2015, 2015-2017). The \code{nsfg()} function reads
the raw data from CDC's website, extracts and recodes selected variables useful for studying childfree adults and other family
statuses, then returns a single data frame.
